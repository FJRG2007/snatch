# Command: ai

**Description**: Interact with an AI model.

**Arguments**:
* `prompt` (optional): Prompt to AI model. 

**Options**:
* `--help` (optional): Display help information for the command.

## Examples

In this case, which is the one we recommend, Snatch will visually ask you what you want to do, as well as give you tips.
```bash
# Starting a new prompt (Recommended).
$ snatch ai
```

In this mode, you ask questions directly to Snatch without going through the prompt "interface".
```bash
# Start a new quick query.
$ snatch ai "Performs advanced CIA research"
```
